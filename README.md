If you want to run the linter with auto-fixing, run:

    make lint-fix

## Build

Run the following command to build the application:

    make clean build

## Test

Testing setup and execution is left to the developer.

## Deploy


### Deploy to Production

Deployment to network-one-production is done by GitHub Actions on a push to the main branch

Ensure that the [.github/workflows/release.yaml](.github/workflows/release.yaml) has the TODO addressed to enable deployment to production
